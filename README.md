## Purpose
The purpose of this system is to allow the residents of Gothenburg to book a dentist appointments with ease. 

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with.

# Design Decisions

- Separation of concerns(SoC):
The team decided based on the requirements given in the guideline, that our system
is to be composed of  more than 4 components, where each component
is separate and independent from the other components, making each component a 
separate working repository. This way we can accomplish the separation of concerns 
and the single responsibility by separating the application into distinct sub-units, 
so each sub-unit addresses a separate concern, and by that achieving a minimal coupling
between the different components.


## Components

# the system consists of 6 components: 
- User Interface
- User Hanlder
- Dentistry Handler
- Timeslot Creator
- Availability checker
- Appointment Handler

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
