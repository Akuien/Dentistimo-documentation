## Team Agreement

### Team mission:

Our mission is to work together as a unified team and be able to successfully complete

our assignments on time with the best outcomes. We aim to work hard all together as a

team and develop a strong sense of problem solving, and productivity.

### Meetings Attendance

Attending the group meetings is an individual responsibility and all members are expected to

attend unless for a good reason (i.e. illness, transport delays, family matters) which must be

communicated in a timely manner.

What project members expect from one another regarding attendance to meetings: Be on

time. Otherwise, contact the Project Manager or team members at least 30 minutes before the

meeting starts.

A total attendance of six members and above is needed to start a meeting or make any

decision affecting the project or the team. No formal decision about the project or team can

be made if the attendance is below the attendance threshold (six members).

### Participation in Project work

● What project members expect from one another regarding participation in the project

work.

All members should be committed and feel responsible for the project's progress and

have full awareness of his/her individual responsibilities.



We agree to help each other and show interest in the work. We are expected to be

open about our mistakes, errors, and approaches to a specific problem. Be involved

and up to date in the project. In case something is difficult, reach out to team members

or schedule a meeting with TA or Teacher.

From a leadership perspective, we agree to work towards a working environment

where every opinion is valued and each idea considered. We will do so while

upholding a respectful, honest and professional tone at all times. A healthy and

positive working environment will both stimulate our creativity and effectiveness. By

signing this contract, we agree to work towards and uphold such an environment. Our

team leadership should be a joint effort from all team members.

### Aims

● The course.

● Grade: 5.

### Holidays

● Christmas and New Year.

Holiday breaks from 22.12.22 to 2.01.23 (including the 26th) During these days

nobody is expected to work and this time should not be compensated for during

working weeks.

### Conflicts

● How to handle them.

First of all, we need to have a respectful and inclusive atmosphere to avoid personal

conflicts. If there happens to be a conflict the project manager should be notified by

either of the parties involved. He/she will try to resolve the conflict with the help of

the other team members by promoting fluid communication. In case nothing works

out well or as expected, the project manager will inform the team TA before taking

any other action.
